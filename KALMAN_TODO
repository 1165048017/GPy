A todo list for the state space models

1) Documentation for the functions

2) implementation for 
Matern32 - Done
Matern52
exponential - Done
bias
white
rbf
periodic Materns >???
periodic rbf

3) Addition and multiplication
addition - computing the sde variables is done, needs brushing
derivatives

multiplication
F = kron_sum(F1, F2)
L, Qc, H P_inf: kron_prod
derivatives!

4) Examples. Just a draw from a mater32. Show that the standard method gives the same result as the SS

5) Tests. Ensure that the log-likelihood is the same for the standard as the SS
          same for the derivatives.

6) plotting
plot the kalman fitered result, and the smoothed result.
